## Do Now:

Rank the following from easiest to hardest:

1. Importing built-in functions
2. Using `randint`
3. Abstraction/creating functions
4. Passing int/str/float/bool arguments into functions
5. Calling a function
6. List syntax
7. Return vs print

We will have a quiz next class covering all of the above topics. Is there any topic you would like to focus on and cover more of? <br><br>

Type the following into the terminal and run the program:

```python
my_list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
# input: a list of strings
# output: None
def my_function(list_argument):
	list_argument[0] = 'z'
print(my_list)
my_function(my_list)
print(my_list)
```
What happened? Try writing a similar program but passing in integers instead of a list. What happens?

## Reading

### Variables and parameters are local

When you create a variable inside a function, it is local, which means that it only exists inside the function. For example:

```python
def together(part1, part2):
    cat = part1 + part2
    print(cat)
```

This function takes two arguments, adds them, and prints the result twice. Here is an example that uses it:

```python
line1 = 'Hello there, '
line2 = 'children.'
# What prints?
```
When cat_twice terminates, the variable cat is destroyed. If we try to print(it, we get an exception:)

```python
>>> print(cat)
NameError: name 'cat' is not defined
```
Parameters are also local. For example, outside `together`, there is no such thing as `part1` or `part2`.

### Aliasing

If `a` refers to an object and you assign `b = a`, then both variables refer to the same object:

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
b is a
True
```

The state diagram looks like:

![State Diagram](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython016.png)

The association of a variable with an object is called a reference. In this example, there are two references to the same object.
An object with more than one reference has more than one name, so we say that the object is aliased.

If the aliased object is mutable, changes made with one alias affect the other:

```python
b[0] = 17
print(a)
[17, 2, 3]
```

Although this behavior can be useful, it is error-prone. In general, it is safer to avoid aliasing when you are working with mutable objects.

## Lab

In PyCharm create a new file called <kbd>Scope_Lab.py</kbd>

### Aliasing

Will updating b affect a? Explain why or why not?

    ```python
    a = [1, 2, 4]
    b = a
    ```
    <br>

Predict what `my_list` list will print out when this code is run. If you are not sure check the code by copying and running it.

    ```python
    # input: a list of ints
    # output: an int
    def update_list(a_list):
        a_list[3] = "yo"
        b = a_list[4]
        b = 100

    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    update_list(my_list)
    ```
    <br>

### Scope

Draw a stack diagram for the following:

```python
var_1 = "kittens"
var_2 = "cookies"
# input: a string
# output: a string
def my_function(my_favorite_things):
    song_lyrics = "rain drops on roses,"
    combined_song = song_lyrics + my_favorite_things
    return combined_song
# input: a string
# output: a string
def my_function_2(item, item2):
    full_lyrics = item + "on " + item2
    full_song = my_function(full_lyrics)
    return full_song
my_song = my_function_2(var_1, var_2)
```

**Write down what (if anything) is wrong with the following code. If there was an issue write out how to fix it. If you are unsure copy and run the code and fix it.**

1\.

```python
var_1 = 'cat'
var_2 = 'dog'

def print_out_my_favorite(favorite_pet):
    if favorite_pet == var_1:
        print("My favorite pet is the cat.")
    if favorite_pet == var_2:
        print("My favorite pet is the dog.")
    var_2 = "cat"

print_out_my_favorite(var_1)
print(var_2)
```

2\.

```python
var_1 = 'cat'
var_2 = 'dog'

def print_out_my_favorite(favorite_pet):
    var_1 = 'dog'
    var_2 = 'cat'
    if favorite_pet == var_1:
        print("My favorite pet is the cat.")
    if favorite_pet == var_2:
        print("My favorite pet is the dog.")

print_out_my_favorite(var_1)
print(var_1 + " " + var_2)
```

3\.

```python
var_1 = 'cat'
var_2 = 'dog'

def print_out_my_favorite(favorite_pet):
    if favorite_pet == var_1:
        print("My favorite pet is the cat.")
    if favorite_pet == var_2:
        print("My favorite pet is the dog.")

print_out_my_favorite(var_1)
print(var_2)
```

* Write a program that has a global variable, `my_num`. Create three functions that update `my_num`:
    1. `add2`: this function adds 2 to `my_num`
    2. `multiply_num`: this function takes in a parameter, `multiplier`, and multiplies `my_num` by that parameter
    3. `add2_and_multiply`: this function takes in a parameter, `multiplier`, and calls `add2`, then calls `multiply_num`.
